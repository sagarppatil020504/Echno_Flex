### 🌟 Echno-Flex: A Financial Forecasting Solution 🚀  

#### **💡 Inspiration**  
The recent **downturn in Hong Kong's stock market 📉** has left investors uncertain, highlighting the growing **fear and lack of financial literacy** in stock investments. To address this, I developed a **DNN-LSTM model 🤖📊** that predicts stock prices for the next **3 to 5 days**. Additionally, I incorporated **sentiment analysis 💬** to assess the market's perception of specific companies, helping investors make informed decisions.  

#### **📌 What It Does**  
Echno-Flex is designed to forecast both **gold 🏆 and stock prices 📈**, two critical pillars of the financial market. It not only predicts future stock trends at **30-interval time steps** but also analyzes **live market sentiment**, providing a **holistic view of investment risks and opportunities**.  

#### **🛠️ How It Was Built**  
The project was developed using **Streamlit 🖥️** for the frontend, **Flask 🌐** for the API, and **Google Colab 🤖** for training the LSTM model. A combination of **CSS 🎨** and **Google Drive ☁️** was used to enhance the UI and manage datasets efficiently.  

#### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**  
Building this project within a **tight 5-day deadline ⏳** was a major challenge. Initially, I attempted to train an **LLM model (LLaMA2) 🦙** as a financial assistant but faced constraints. Another **last-minute issue ⏱️** arose when an **API call to Colab failed**, requiring me to **push the model output to Google Drive 📂** and retrieve the CSV manually.  

#### **🏆 Accomplishments**  
Despite **time constraints**, I successfully developed a working **prototype ✅**. While some refinements remain, the project **achieved its core objectives**—demonstrating the feasibility of **AI-driven financial forecasting**.  

#### **🎓 Lessons Learned**  
Through this project, I gained **hands-on experience** in **API development 🔗**, **LSTM-based time series forecasting 📈**, and the **integration of AI with financial data 💰**. It also strengthened my **problem-solving skills** in handling real-time data and deployment challenges.  

#### **👨‍🏫 The Role of My Mentor**  
Throughout this journey, I was **guided and mentored** by **Rahul H Shettgar 🤝**, whose expertise and insights played a **crucial role** in shaping the project. His mentorship **helped me navigate technical roadblocks** and refine the model's implementation.  

#### **🚀 What’s Next for Echno-Flex?**  
The ultimate vision is to develop a **comprehensive financial web application 🌍💰** that can assist users in **investment planning 📊, risk analysis 📉, and real-time market predictions ⏳**. Future enhancements will include **broader asset coverage, improved AI models, and user-friendly financial insights**.  

#### **🛠️ Tech Stack Used**  
- **Python 🐍** (for model training and API)  
- **LSTM (Deep Learning Model 🤖)**  
- **Flask 🌐** (Backend API)  
- **Streamlit 🖥️** (Frontend UI)  
- **CSS3 🎨** (UI Styling)  
- **Google Drive ☁️** (Data Management)  

This project marks a **step toward bridging the gap between AI 🤖 and finance 💰**, empowering individuals with **smarter investment insights 📊🚀**.
