Inspiration
The downfall of Hong Kong's economy (stock prices) in recent days has left investors in distress ,so I have developed the DNN LSTM model to predict the price for next 3-5 days and some more add-ons which tend to support that kind of idea People are afraid of investment in stocks and don't have much knowledge on investment and handling money .

What it does
My project was focused on gold and stock price prediction as they are two important pillars of the financial condition. It checks the live sentiment in the market of that particular company and predicts what could be the stocks of next 30 interval

How we built it
I built it using streamlit and a bit of css with flask as API with Colab effort for training a LSTM model

Challenges we ran into
Building it in 5 days Tried to train an LLM model (llama2) for the role of assistant . The last minute challenge was the api call to the colab which failed so I had push it to my drive and then to the take the csv file from it

Accomplishments that we're proud of
I was able to do in time a bit of incompleteness is there as

What we learned
I learnt to do basic API calls and LSTM model for this purpose

What's next for Echno-Flex
Deploy a full end to end web app that can solve any financial related issue.
